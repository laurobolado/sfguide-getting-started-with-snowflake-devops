/*
To join the flight and location focused tables 
we need to cross the gap between the airport and cities domains. 
For this we make use of a Snowpark Python UDF. 
What's really cool is that Snowpark allows us to define a vectorized UDF 
making the processing super efficient as we donâ€™t have to invoke the 
function on each row individually!

To compute the mapping between airports and cities, 
we use SnowflakeFile to read a JSON list from the pyairports package. 
The SnowflakeFile class provides dynamic file access, to stream files of any size.
